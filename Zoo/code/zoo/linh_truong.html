In Vietnam, a rare and endemic species, named in the "Red Book" of Vietnam and the world; should be protected. It is one of five primate species at risk of global extinction</p>
            <img src="img/vooc_quan_trang.jpg" width="100" height="150">
        <h2>Characteristics</h2>
             <p>Body weight 8.1 - 9 kg; head and body length 0.46 - 0.665 m. On the top of the head, there is a black crest, quite wide white hair streaks on the cheeks that extend above the ears. The legs have black fur. The white buttock extends up to the base of the tail and thighs; long limbs. The tail is longer than the body, the tail is black. Food is mainly for shoots, leaves and fruits.</p>
        <h2>Distribution</h2>
              <p>Delacour's langurs are distributed in old forests, primary forests on rocky mountains with many caves. According to a survey by the Frankfurk Animal Protection Association (Germany) in Vietnam, the white-shanked langur is only in Vietnam with more than 200 individuals, distributed at 18 separate points in the provinces of Ninh Binh and Ha. Nam, Hoa Binh and Thanh Hoa.  In Vietnam, Trachypithecus delacouri is concentrated in two places: Van Long wetland nature reserve and Cuc Phuong National Park</p>
               
        <h1>Pygathrix cinerea</h1>
              <p>Pygathrix cinerea is an endemic species of Vietnam, distributed in the central Annamites, in the provinces of Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Binh Dinh, Kon Tum and Gia Lai, Vietnam. The population of the population is estimated about 550 - 700. In 2016, Fauna & Flora International - Vietnam Program in Vietnam (Dr. Benjamin Rawson vs cs., 2016) announced the discovery of a population of 500 Pygathrix cinerea in the West. Vietnam and the total number of this species to 1000.</p>

            <p>P. cinerea hunts down, culturally, interested in your problems, 20 years old, their ideas. Our 20 parts are part of each other. Software when fitteds</p>
         <h2>Shape</h2>
            <p>All three genera (Pygathrix nemaeus, Pygathrix cinerea and Pygathrix nigripes) have a gray body with white hairs on the buttocks. Shoulder and hands are black. The hair on the head is gray but has a black rim on the forehead. They have a white beard, while the neck is long, reddish. Their eyes are slightly slanted. Hand rub longer than legs. The tail is long and white. Males are slightly larger than females and weigh on average about 10.9 kg. The female weighs
               about 8.2 kg. The difference between the three types of patch is the fur from the bottom down. Pygathrix cinerea, as the name suggests, has gray legs. The arms are also gray. They have them very close to the red-footed scrub, while the black-footed-patch-rub is far from them</p>

         <h2>Character</h2>
             <p>Pygathrix cinerea is a daytime active species that mainly lives in trees. They move through the branches by jumping and transmitting branches. In the past, they were usually found in large groups of 50 individuals, but this number has now decreased significantly from 4 to 15 individuals. Males are often the dominant and dominant role (this conclusion was made by observing them in captivity). The gray-footed scrub communicates with each other by touching, through images
               and hearing sounds. Roar is often a sign of anger. It could be a sign of intimidation of an individual. Gentle chirping is often a sign of obedience. The gray-shanked scrub usually grooms hair to remove parasites and to create and strengthen the bonds between members of the herd. This activity is usually done before dinner. Members can also show aggressive behavior by fighting, beating, pulling and pouncing each other.               Visual communication includes facial expressions and various postures. Facial expressions can be grimace, showing obedience, a playful attitude when playing with other members, and staring at showing curiosity or anger. Facial expressions are also evident in the stage of partner selection. Males will look to the female to show that they are ready to mate. Their food is almost entirely leafy, but sometimes also adds seeds, fruit and flowers. They like young leaves and immature fruit</p>

         <h2>Reproduction</h2>
              <p>The mating season usually begins between August and December. The gestation period of females lasts from 165 to 190 days. When mating, males often show the appearance that they are ready to mate. They will hold their chin forward, shake their heads and raise or lower their eyebrows. The other will respond with the same action. This is repeated many times. The offspring will then agree to mate. The breeding season usually takes place between January and August, during the ripe fruit season. The mother will give birth to a calf weighing about 500 to 720g. Children will be able to start breeding when they are about 4 years old.</p>
                    <h1>Rhinopithecus avunculus</h1>

They are usually found at elevations of 200 to 1,200 m (700 to 3,900 ft) in forest patches in Tuyen Quang, Cao Bang, Yen Bai, Quang Ninh and Ha Giang. Coffee was discovered in the late 1860s when cleric Armand David sent the first individual to Europe but it was not until 1912
               that it was first described for biology, then rediscovered in 1990 but still extremely rare period. By 2008, fewer than 250 individuals were thought to exist and the species was subject to special conservation. They are threatened by habitat loss and poaching, are listed as "endangered" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and are also listed in the Vietnam Red Data Book.</p>

      <h1>Monkey Con Dao long tail</h1>
             <p>Monkey Con Dao long tail is a subspecies of macaque distributed in Vietnam, concentrated in Con Dao, Phu Quoc. Monkey Con Dao long tail is endemic to Vietnam.</p>
             <img src="img/khi_con_dao.jpg" width="100" height="150" style="padding:0 0 0 220px">
      <h2>Source</h2>
             <p>Regarding the origin of the Monkey Con Dao long tail, the evolutionary theory of the distribution, dispersion and origin of sub-species suggests that before 18,000 years ago, the sea level was lower than it is now, from the Eastern Peninsula. Ocean to Bali (Indonesia) is a large contiguous land and macaque distributed everywhere. After that, the sea level rose as high as today, forming islands, populations of long-tailed macaque living on isolated islands and forming a number of sub-species, including subspecies of Monkey Con Dao long tail.</p>
      <h2>Describe</h2>
             <p>Their coat color is usually gray to reddish-brown, behind the lighter body. The hair on the head grows back. Crested often. The face is pink. Males often have two white tufts of fur on their mouths on the sides like the mustache. The female has more sparse hair around her mouth. the apical part of the long-tailed macaque lives in the Can Gio mangrove forest and the Ca Mau mangrove forest is darker in color than the fur at the top of the Con Dao long-tailed macaque. The offspring are born black. The tail is long and well covered with feathers, the length of the tail is usually 3/4 or more than the body length. The male's tail is shorter than the land species. Maturity at 50 - 51 months. The gestation period is 160 - 170 days. The time between reproductive 13 months (12 - 24 months). Life time 37-38 years.</p>
      <h2>character</h2>
             <p>They live in primary, secondary forests, bamboo forests, evergreen forests, sparse forests, river banks, coastal areas, coastal mangroves, along rivers to an altitude of 2000m. At Con Dao National Park, there are at least 10 common sites, these are located on 3 islands: Con Son, Hon Ba, and Bay Bay Hon.
            Before 1975, this species was also common in forests in southern provinces from Thua Thien - Hue province to Kien Giang province with an estimated area of> 5,000 km2. Since 1975, the status of the species has changed dramatically. The number of population plummeted. The current number of sub-populations is about 30. The reason is that the habitat is encroached, the forest is cut down, the natural forest area is narrowed and this is the target for hunting
             for meat, cooking, trading and export.  The main food is fruits (64%), seeds, nuts, leaves of other plant and animal parts such as insects and frogs, etc. They are active during the day and in the trees. This species swims very well and often jumps into the water from tree branches. Very often sitting in groups on the main road, do not panic when the car passes.
                         They often live in groups, rarely encountering one. The structure has many males and females with an average of 2.5 females per male. They live in groups of 10-100 birds. The males usually mark the area less like other monkeys. The young often play with each other in the herd. They usually joke with each other for two years. Males often joke with males, females often joke with females.</p>
